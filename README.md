# Job Application Tracker

A full-stack job application tracker built with FastAPI, SQLModel, SQLite, React, and Vite.

The project lets users view existing applications, add a new application quickly, update entries, delete entries, mark favorites, export data to CSV, and view summary information in a dashboard.

## Requirements Coverage

This project satisfies the requested requirements:

- Users can list existing entries and add a new entry in under a minute from launch.
- The app includes small extra features such as favorites, summary metrics, charts, and CSV export.
- The README explains how to run the backend API and the frontend interface side-by-side on a local machine.

## Features

### Backend

- Export visible applications to CSV
- Light and dark mode
- Automated interface workflow test with Vitest and Testing Library

## Setup

### 1. Create and activate a virtual environment

```bash
uv venv
source .venv/bin/activate
```

### 2. Install backend dependencies

```bash
uv sync --dev
```

### 3. Install frontend dependencies

```bash
cd frontend
npm install
cd ..
```

## Run the Project Locally

Run the backend and frontend in two separate terminals.

### Terminal 1: Run the API

```bash
source .venv/bin/activate
uv run uvicorn app.main:app --reload
```

Backend URLs:

- API: `http://127.0.0.1:8000`
- Swagger docs: `http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs`

### Terminal 2: Run the frontend

```bash
cd frontend
npm run dev
```

Frontend URL:

- Interface: `http://127.0.0.1:5173`

## Running Tests

Run backend tests:

```bash
uv run pytest
```

Run frontend interface tests:

```bash
cd frontend
npm test -- --run
```

Verify the frontend production build:

```bash
cd frontend
npm run build
```

## Seed Script

To populate the database with sample data:

```bash
uv run python scripts/seed.py
```

The seed script is useful for quickly populating the app with demo records for development and presentation.

## requests.http

The `requests.http` file contains manual API request examples. It can be used from IDE HTTP clients to test the backend endpoints without using the frontend.

## Interface Testing

The frontend includes one automated interface workflow test in `frontend/tests/App.test.jsx`.

That test verifies a basic user flow:

- open the app
- go to the Applications page
- fill in the add form
- submit a new application
- verify the new application appears in the UI

## Example Request Body

```json
{
  "company": "Example Company",
  "position": "Backend Developer",
  "status": "applied",
  "location": "Tel Aviv",
  "applied_date": "2026-03-25",
  "source": "LinkedIn",
  "notes": "Sent CV",
  "favorite": false
}
```

## Design

The backend follows a simple layered structure:

- Routes layer: handles HTTP requests
- Schemas layer: validates request and response data
- Models layer: defines database structure with SQLModel
- Database layer: manages persistence using SQLite

The current API routes use SQLModel sessions with SQLite for persistence, while the frontend provides the full user interface.

## Notes

- The backend uses SQLite through SQLModel for persistence.
- The frontend is designed for quick application tracking and management.
- The current implementation uses a real database and a seed script, but migrations are not yet included.

## AI Assistance

This project was developed with support from AI tools during implementation and debugging.

### How AI was used

- Exploring project structure ideas
- Understanding FastAPI and SQLModel integration
- Debugging frontend and backend issues
- Improving UI layout and feature behavior
- Refining README and project documentation

### How outputs were verified

- Code was reviewed manually before use
- Backend behavior was tested locally
- Endpoints were checked through Swagger and manual requests
- Frontend behavior was checked locally in the browser
- Seed behavior and UI flows were tested during development
